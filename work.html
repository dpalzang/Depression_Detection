        <p class="texts"> In 2022, it was estimated that there were more than 300 million depressed people  worldwide, or 5% of the world's population.
            The National Mental Health Survey 2022 in India found that 1 in 3 Indians has  depression and the cases stand at over 56 million and that 
            nearly 15% of Indian  adults require active intervention for one or more mental health issues.
            About 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide every year. 164,033 Indians  committed suicide in 2021.
            People aged 15 to 49 being the most affected. It is the second most common  reason for death among people in this age group.
            However, not much importance is given to mental health awareness or means to  help patients battle depression.
            This depression detection system aims to diagnose and identify the type of  depression (anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
            or bipolar disorder)  and suggests professional help.
